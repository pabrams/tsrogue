#+title: r/roguelikedev summer tutorial
#+date: <2020-06-18 Thu>

I had previously followed the r/roguelikedev summer tutorial series, using Rust, with the goal of learning Rust. I got halfway through. 
I learned a lot of Rust. In part I gave up because Rust frustrated me, especially with libtcod.
This year I decided that instead to use a language I already know, Javascript. I'll use [[https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/][rot.js]].
